What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/sushil/version-control/reflections/.git/
needs to be commited. As foolows:
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflecions.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

---------------------------------------------------------------
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging Area:
A place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to Git.
They are not in the repository yet.
