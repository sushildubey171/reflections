How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Due to direct pin point of changes from old to new with help of diff commands helps me easily find typo and bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can easily compare the changes that have been made over the time and i can go back to previous version to make newer verion more efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros of manual commit: commit only when any logical changes have been made.
commit log will be small if we commit very carefully.
easy to comapre two commits.
cons of manual commit: commit size may be large or small.
may forget to commit on logical change.
pros and cons of automatically saved:
commit history may be large.
unncessary commit on unlogical chnages.
automatically saved commit helps user if he forgets manually to commit.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
many source code file needs to be updated simultaneouly if there is change in one file so git is perfect, while some the of the document need not be updated when we are making any changes to other document because they may not be dependent on each other.
------------------------------------------------------------
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
enter in the repository directory and type git log and enter q.
get the two id's of 'commit' to be compared 
type git diff first'id second'id
no check the differences between two files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
for my android projects
